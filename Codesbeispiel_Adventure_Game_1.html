<p style="font-size:20px;"> When it comes to programming, I find it easiest to learn by doing. I could watch endless tutorials and learn nothing, but by starting my own projects and learning along the way, I feel much more confident about my abilities. I still have a lot to learn to make a decent game, but I am pretty proud that this game works! </p>
