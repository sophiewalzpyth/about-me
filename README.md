# project-about-me
This project is not meant as a professional profile or portfolio. It is designed for me to learn through practice and be able to demonstrate what I am learning to friends, family, and anyone else intersted. 
Although I currently use it to demonstrate progress I have made, it focuses on practicing declarative programming. It may contain some odd formatting or use of language since I am in the middle of a learnign process.
