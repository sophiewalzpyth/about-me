<h1> Some Job Search Thoughts </h1>
<h2 style="font-size:30px; background-color:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7);"><br> Company Pros and Cons <br><br></h2>
<div>
<p style="font-size: 20px;"> As with every job search, heavy emphasis is placed on the “Why Me” aspect. Since I am applying to jobs that do not align completely to my degree programs, but rather to the interests that I developed while studying, my cover letters and “Anschreibungen” require much more emphasis on what I have to offer. This, however, does <em> not </em> mean I do not take a great interest in the companies I am applying to! Here I decided to create a short pros and cons list to explain important aspects I look for. </p>

<p style="color:green;"> <h2>Pros</h2> 
<ul>
<li><h3> Response to Employee Reviews and Complaints </h3></li>
	<ul>
	<li style="font-size: 20px;"> As a company, it is probably easy to respond to positive reviews. While I take these reviews into account, I find it much more important to see how a company responds to criticism. A company (more specifically, their PR or HR person) should be equipped to deal with complaints from current and ex-employees. Though there may be nothing they can do to improve the situation, it is important to acknowledge the differences in opinion, and develop improvements or resolutions when possible. A company that can respond respectfully and productively emphasizes their ability to adjust and improve themselves.
	</li>
	</ul>
<br>
<li><h3>Opportunities and Encouragement for Employees to Improve Themselves</h3></li>
	<ul>
	<li style="font-size: 20px;"> As I look for a career, I do not imagine myself completing the same tasks each day without improvement. I am too curious to give up on learning simply because I am no longer <em> “required” </em></q> to.  My ideal job will allow me to evolve my skills and encourage self-improvement that benefits the company as well. 
	</li>
	</ul>
<li><h3>Individualized Trainee Programs</h3></li>
	<ul>
	<li style="font-size: 20px;"> While this may seem like a trivial aspect of a company, employers who value and respect the different talents and learning speeds of their employees stand out to me. I find it very discouraging to spend hours being trained in something where I might have specialized skills due to a standardized training process. By avoiding unproductive activities, I can spend more time imroving weak points or developing projects that might be useful in the future. 
	</li>
	</ul>
</ul>
</p>
<br>
<p style="color:red;"> <h2>Cons</h2>
<ul>
<li><h3> Dishonest Company Reviews </h3></li>
	<ul>
	<li style="font-size: 20px;"> For me, these are a HUGE red flag. I have completed an application to the very last step, where I simply needed to click the submit button, and then abandoned it completely. Why? The company had a reputation of creating fake reviews to bolster their ratings. When I glanced through the reviews again, some stood out as fishy, much like the unverified product reviews on Amazon that claim “Amazing product” and then give a 1-star review <br>
	</li> 
	</ul>
<li> <h3> Disrespectful Responses on Public Platforms </h3></li>
	<ul>
	<li style="font-size: 20px;"> Similar to dishonest practices, blatant disrespect to previous employees or customers demonstrates a lack of professionalism and a possibility of a hostile work environment. We have all seen reviews that are absurd or disrespectful themselves, but a company’s responses should remain within an acceptable spectrum of being civil. 
	</li>
	</ul>
<li><h3> Disorganized Websites </h3></li>
	<ul>
	<li style="font-size: 20px;"> When trying to apply to a company, I like to visit their website and get a broad idea of who they are, what they do, if they value innovation, etc. If I cannot navigate their website in a reasonable amount of time, or I cannot decipher the companies values through the clutter, I will most likely not continue with the application process. While not all companies are tech companies, a clean and organized website is a valuable asset. If I click through their entire website and still have no idea what they have to offer, it does not leave me with a good impression about how well the internal structure of the company is organized.
	</li>
	</ul>
</ul>
</p>
<br>
<br>

<p style="font-size: 20px;"> This list is strictly my own opinions that I have developed during my most recent job search. </p>
