<p class="main" style="font-size: 20px;"> Since job hunting is such an awfully long venture, I spend a shocking amount of time between applying and receiving an answer. I have never been one to sit around and wait for circumstances to change themselves. Instead, I have been scoring the internet for new ways to learn or improve upon my skills. Without a job at the moment, I cannot afford fancy and accredited certificates or programs. However, most of these programs can be completed for free, meaning I can still develop whichever skills I am interested in. I have decided to use my HTML-5 learning project (this website) to display the abilities I have that a resume cannot quite capture.
