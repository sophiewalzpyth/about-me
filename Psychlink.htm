<p class="main"> During Spring 2018, I completed my psychology capstone research. Using data collected from four <q>PSYC 101</q> classes, I tested my hypothesis (students who participated in extracurricular acitivities in high school would have better grades in a freshman level class). Using SPSS, I analyzed my data to drew conclusions based on the results. In April 2018, I presented my results at the West Virginia University capstone poster session. </p>
